Today's podcast guest is Kat Zieñ who is a Fincrime engineer at Monzo, a co-organiser at PHP South West and London Gophers.
Kat gave a talk on PHP performance optimisation at Sunshine PHP (SunPHP19) in Miami and was kind enough to be on the podcast after her talk.

In this episode Kat talks about being both a PHP and Go developer and ask lots of question about her PHP optimisation talk.

Kat is speaking at PHP UK in a few weeks and she has lots of other speaking engagements booked for this year.
